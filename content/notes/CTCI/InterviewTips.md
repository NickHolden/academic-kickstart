Along the top as columns list major aspects of my resume. This includes each project, job, or activity. On the left, we have common behavioral questions. In the cells, I can put talking points for specific projects that I can use to answer these types of questions.

### Weaknesses

When asked about weaknesses, give a real weakness but make sure to mention how I overcame it.

### Questions to ask the interviewer

#### Genuine Questions

These types of questions are the questions that I actually want to know the answer to.

1. What is the ratio of testers to developers to program managers? What is the interaction like? How does project planning happen on the team?
2. What brought you to this company? What has been most challenging for you?

#### Insightful Questions

These questions demonstrate knowledge or understanding of technology. These types of questions usually require research about companies in advance.

1. I noticed that you use *technology X*. How do you handle *problem Y?*
2. Why did the product choose to use *X* protocol over *Y* protocol? I know it has benefits *A, B, C* but many companies choose not to use it because of issue *D.*

#### Passion Questions

These questions are to demonstrate passion for technology.

1. I'm very interested in scalability, and I'd love to learn more about it. What opportunities are there at this company to learn about this?
2. I'm not familiar with *technology X,* but its sounds like a very interesting solution. Could you tell me a bit more about how it works?

### Know My Technical Projects

I should focus on two or three technical projects that I should deeply master.

- The project had challenging components (outside of just "learning a lot").
- I played a central role (ideally on the challenging components).
- I can talk at technical depth about it.

For these projects, make sure I can talk about challenges, mistakes, technical decisions, choice of technologies, and things that I would do differently.

### Responding to Behavioral Questions

- Be specific about answers, but not arrogant. Describe specific parts that I did that were challenging.
- Give structured answers. There are two common ways to structure responses.
  - **Nugget First:** start response with a "nugget" that succinctly describes what my response will be about.
  - **S.A.R (Situation, Action, Result):** Start off with outlining the situation, explaining the actions I took, and describe the result. Focus on the action.

|             | Nugget | Situation | Action(s) | Result | What It Says |
| ----------- | ------ | --------- | --------- | ------ | ------------ |
| **Story 1** |        |           |           |        |              |
| **Story 2** |        |           |           |        |              |

### Tell Me About Yourself

Make sure to sprinkle in shows of success.

1. Current Role [Headline Only]
2. College
3. Post College
4. Current Role [Details]
5. Outside of Work
6. Wrap Up
