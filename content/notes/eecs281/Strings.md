# Rabin-Karp Fingerprints

## understand what Rabin-Karp fingerprints are

an algorithm which takes a string and turns it into a number. we want the algorithm to be fairly complex to reduce collisions. 

main point: turn a string into a number and reduce collisions

## why it is useful

## why we would use them

## how to calculate
